### OBS.:

I create a webpage to track my reading progress. I coded a table in each page.

## v2.0.0

On this update I changed the table layout to something prettier. I divided the content in sections, so each book is sorted by serie name, I also added books covers. The book covers have hover effect that in the future will show some information about the book and reading status.  
I added a header with a logo and a burger menu using some JavaScript.  
I'll add in future updates a card sliding feature. I'm gonna make an more responsive layout, too.
